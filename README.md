## Whaaa?

Bash-sex (**s**ource **ex**tra) is a trivial plugin system for your bash shell. Use responsibly.

## Usage

Firstly, clone the repo into your `~/.config/` directory.

Then add the following to your `.bashrc`:

```
. ~/.config/bash-sex/foreplay
```

Then use either

```
sex --ask-once  # propose it first
```

or, if you really want this...

``` 
sex --yes
```

Those can be placed in your `.bashrc` as well, if you feel addicted to `bash-sex` (no support group yet, sorry!)
